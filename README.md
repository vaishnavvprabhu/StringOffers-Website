# String Offers PHP Website

Welcome to the String Offers PHP Website repository, developed by Vaishnav for the company named "String Offers". This repository contains the codebase for the company's website built using PHP.
## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to clone the repository on your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository-name>.git
```

Once you have the codebase on your local machine, you'll need to set up a web server and a database to run the website locally. You can use a tool like XAMPP or MAMP to set up a local server environment.

After setting up your server, navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

This command will start a PHP development server on http://localhost:8000.
